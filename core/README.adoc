= Core Library Example

Demonstrates how to evaluate Pkl modules with the _pkl-core_ Java library.

_pkl-core_ is a low-level library.
For a more convenient way to consume Pkl configuration,

and xref:../config-kotlin/README.adoc[Kotlin Configuration Example].

To run this example, type `../gradlew build` (requires JDK 11 or higher).
